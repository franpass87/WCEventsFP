<!-- 
## Gap Priority Definitions

**Priority 1 (Critical)**: Release blockers, security issues, major functionality broken
**Priority 2 (High)**: Important quality issues, performance problems, user experience gaps  
**Priority 3 (Medium)**: Enhancement opportunities, minor issues, technical debt

## Effort Estimation Guidelines

**Small (1-2 days)**: Simple fixes, configuration changes, minor updates
**Medium (3-5 days)**: Feature implementation, significant refactoring, complex fixes
**Large (1-2 weeks)**: Major architecture changes, new system integration, comprehensive overhauls
