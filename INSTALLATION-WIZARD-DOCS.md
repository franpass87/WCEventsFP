# WCEventsFP Installation Documentation

## ⚠️ NOTICE: Installation System Removed

**As of version 2.1.1+**, the step-by-step installation wizard and progressive loading system have been **completely removed** per user request.

### Current Behavior:
- ✅ **Immediate Activation**: Plugin loads all features directly upon activation
- ✅ **No Setup Steps**: No wizard or progressive installation required  
- ✅ **Full Functionality**: All plugin features are available immediately
- ✅ **Simplified**: No installation status tracking or configuration steps

### Migration:
If you previously used the setup wizard, your existing settings will continue to work. The plugin will automatically clean up old installation-related options during activation.

## Legacy Documentation (No Longer Applicable)

The following documentation describes the **former** installation system that has been removed:

## The Problem

The original WCEventsFP plugin, despite having extensive WSOD prevention measures, was still causing issues because it was trying to load too much at once:

- 21,477+ lines of PHP code across 40+ files
- Complex dependency injection container system
- Multiple service providers loading simultaneously
- All features initialized during `plugins_loaded` hook

Even with safety nets, this could overwhelm servers with limited resources or slow environments.

## The Solution

### 1. Installation Wizard (`wcefp-setup-wizard.php`)

A comprehensive setup wizard that:
- **Guides users** through safe plugin configuration step-by-step
- **Tests environment** before loading any heavy features
- **Allows feature selection** so users only enable what they need
- **Provides recommendations** based on server performance
- **Prevents WSOD** by validating everything before activation

#### Wizard Steps:
1. **Welcome & Quick Check** - Basic environment validation
2. **System Requirements** - Detailed server compatibility check  
3. **Feature Selection** - Choose which features to enable
4. **Performance Configuration** - Optimize settings for your server
5. **Safe Activation** - Progressive plugin initialization
6. **Setup Complete** - Access to dashboard and feature management

### 2. Installation Manager (`includes/Core/InstallationManager.php`)

Manages different installation modes:

- **`minimal`** - Only core features (for limited servers)
- **`progressive`** - Load features gradually over multiple requests
- **`standard`** - Normal loading for good servers  
- **`full`** - All features at once (high-performance servers only)

### 3. Progressive Loading System

Instead of loading everything at once:
- **Core features load first** (essential functionality)
- **Additional features load gradually** (2-3 per page load)
- **Heavy features scheduled for later** (background installation)
- **Fallback systems** if any step fails

### 4. Feature Management Dashboard (`includes/Admin/FeatureManager.php`)

Administrative interface providing:
- **Feature toggle switches** - Enable/disable features individually
- **Performance monitoring** - Track resource usage
- **Installation status** - See what's loaded and what's pending
- **Server recommendations** - Optimize for your environment
- **Reset functionality** - Start over if needed

## Key Features

### ✅ WSOD Prevention
- Multiple safety nets and fallback systems
- Environment validation before loading
- Progressive loading prevents resource exhaustion
- Detailed error reporting instead of blank screens

### ✅ User-Friendly Setup
- Interactive wizard with clear instructions
- Performance recommendations based on server capabilities
- No technical knowledge required

- Server performance scoring

### ✅ Administrative Control
- Full dashboard for feature management
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Installation status tracking
