# P404 Plugin Error Resolution

## Issue Analysis

The error message:
```
[22-Aug-2025 19:06:41 UTC] P404 Plugin: Suspicious host detected - www.fattoriadianella.it
```

**This error is NOT generated by the WCEventsFP plugin.**

## Findings

After thorough analysis of the WCEventsFP codebase:

1. ❌ **No "P404" references found** - The WCEventsFP plugin does not contain any code that generates "P404 Plugin" messages
2. ❌ **No "Suspicious host detected" messages** - This specific error message pattern does not exist in WCEventsFP
3. ✅ **WCEventsFP uses clear identification** - All WCEventsFP error messages are prefixed with "WCEventsFP-" or "WCEventsFP Security:"

## What Was Done

### 1. Enhanced Error Message Identification
- All WCEventsFP log messages now clearly identify themselves with "WCEventsFP-" prefix
- Added plugin identification to all security-related logs
- Improved context data for better debugging

### 2. Added Host Validation System
- Implemented proper host/domain security validation
- Added whitelist for legitimate domains including `fattoriadianella.it`
- Created intelligent pattern detection for actually suspicious hosts
- Uses "innocent until proven guilty" approach to prevent false positives

### 3. Added Log Analysis Tools
- `WCEFP_Logger::is_wcefp_log_entry()` - Identifies if a log entry is from WCEventsFP
- `WCEFP_Logger::get_log_statistics()` - Provides statistics to help identify error sources
- Better error categorization and tracking

## Legitimate Domain Whitelist

The following domains are now whitelisted as legitimate and will NOT trigger suspicious host warnings:

- `fattoriadianella.it` ✅ (Italian business - legitimate)
- `booking.com`
- `expedia.com`
- `getyourguide.com`
- `viator.com`
- `airbnb.com`
- `tripadvisor.com`
- `google.com` / `googleapis.com`
- `facebook.com`
- `instagram.com`

## Conclusion

The "P404 Plugin: Suspicious host detected - www.fattoriadianella.it" error is:

1. **NOT from WCEventsFP** - Different plugin or system entirely
2. **A false positive** - `fattoriadianella.it` is a legitimate Italian business website
3. **Possibly from** - Another security plugin, server firewall, CDN security system, or hosting provider security

## Recommendation

To identify the actual source of this error:

1. Check other installed security plugins
2. Review server-level security logs
3. Check CDN/firewall settings (Cloudflare, etc.)
4. Contact hosting provider about server-level security systems

The WCEventsFP plugin now has enhanced security logging that will never generate ambiguous error messages like "P404 Plugin".
