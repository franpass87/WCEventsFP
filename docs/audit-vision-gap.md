| Type Declarations | Partial | Complete | ⚠️ | Add return types, property types |
| Error Handling | Try-catch | Typed exceptions | ⚠️ | Enhance exception handling |

### WordPress Integration
| Component | Current | Target | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| WP Version | ≥5.0 | ≥6.5 | ❌ | Update minimum requirements |

---

## 🛡️ Security Audit

### Current Security Measures
✅ **Implemented:**
- Nonce verification in AJAX handlers
- Capability checks in admin functions
- Input sanitization in form processing
- SQL prepared statements in database queries

❌ **Missing/Incomplete:**
- Systematic escaping of output data
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- File upload security validation

### Security Vulnerabilities
1. **Output Escaping**: Several instances of direct variable output without escaping
2. **File Permissions**: Some files may have overly permissive permissions
3. **API Security**: Rate limiting needs strengthening
4. **Input Validation**: Additional server-side validation required

## ⚡ Performance Analysis

### Current Performance Features
✅ **Optimizations:**
- Conditional asset loading
- Database query optimization
- Caching system implementation
- Autoload optimization

⚠️ **Performance Issues:**
- Heavy admin page loads
- Potential N+1 query problems in event listings
- Large JavaScript bundles
- Unminified assets in some contexts

### Recommendations
1. Implement fragment caching for complex queries
2. Optimize asset bundling and minification
3. Add lazy loading for admin data tables
4. Database index optimization
